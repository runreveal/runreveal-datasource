# Grafana data source plugin template

This template is a starting point for building a Data Source Plugin for Grafana.

## What are Grafana data source plugins?

Grafana supports a wide range of data sources, including Prometheus, MySQL, and even Datadog. There’s a good chance you can already visualize metrics from the systems you have set up. In some cases, though, you already have an in-house metrics solution that you’d like to add to your Grafana dashboards. Grafana Data Source Plugins enables integrating such solutions with Grafana.

## Getting started


### Frontend

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   yarn run install
   ```

2. Build plugin in development mode and run in watch mode

   ```bash
   yarn run dev
   ```

3. Build plugin in production mode

   ```bash
   yarn run build
   ```

4. Run the tests (using Jest)

   ```bash
   # Runs the tests and watches for changes, requires git init first
   yarn run test

   # Exits after running all the tests
   yarn run test:ci
   ```

5. Spin up a Grafana instance and run the plugin inside it (using Docker)

   ```bash
   yarn run server
   ```

6. Run the E2E tests (using Cypress)

   ```bash
   # Spins up a Grafana instance first that we tests against
   yarn run server

   # Starts the tests
   yarn run e2e
   ```

7. Run the linter

   ```bash
   yarn run lint

   # or

   yarn run lint:fix
   ```


# Distributing your plugin

When distributing a Grafana plugin either within the community or privately the plugin must be signed so the Grafana application can verify its authenticity. This can be done with the `@grafana/sign-plugin` package.

_Note: It's not necessary to sign a plugin during development. The docker development environment that is scaffolded with `@grafana/create-plugin` caters for running the plugin without a signature._

## Initial steps

Before signing a plugin please read the Grafana [plugin publishing and signing criteria](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/developers/plugins/publishing-and-signing-criteria/) documentation carefully.

`@grafana/create-plugin` has added the necessary commands and workflows to make signing and distributing a plugin via the grafana plugins catalog as straightforward as possible.

Before signing a plugin for the first time please consult the Grafana [plugin signature levels](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/developers/plugins/sign-a-plugin/#plugin-signature-levels) documentation to understand the differences between the types of signature level.

1. Create a [Grafana Cloud account](https://grafana.com/signup).
2. Make sure that the first part of the plugin ID matches the slug of your Grafana Cloud account.
   - _You can find the plugin ID in the plugin.json file inside your plugin directory. For example, if your account slug is `acmecorp`, you need to prefix the plugin ID with `acmecorp-`._
3. Create a Grafana Cloud API key with the `PluginPublisher` role.
4. Keep a record of this API key as it will be required for signing a plugin

## Release

To trigger the workflow we need to push a version tag to github. This can be achieved with the following steps:

1. Create a new branch for the release.
2. Update any files needed.
3. Bump version number in the `package.json` file.
4. Add a new section to the `CHANGELOG.md` file. This file is published with the plugin and is visible by people viewing our plugin.
5. Once the PR is merged, add a tag to the repo with the same name as the version `v#.#.#`.
6. Upload the new release to grafana.com to get published.

## Provisioning

### PreSetup

Get a testing workspace ID and generate an api key with the `analyst` role.

Base64 encode the key (if not already done so) in the format `:<key>` where key is preceded by a colon.

### Running the Provisioning File

Run the following commands replacing `<workspace_id>` and `<session>` with their respective values.

```bash
export RRDS_WORKSPACE_ID=<workspace_id>
export RRDS_SESSION_TOKEN=<session> 
docker-compose up
```

This will set the environment variables needed to correctly spin up the docker instance and auto provision the datasource.
